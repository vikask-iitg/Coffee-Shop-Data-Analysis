Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze retail sales data to derive actionable insights that can improve the overall performance of the coffee shop.

Step 1: Data Cleaning

1. Size Segmentation
Extracted sizes from the product column (e.g., Small, Regular, Large) and placed them in a separate column.

2. Total Bill Calculation
Calculated the total bill for each order by multiplying the transaction quantity by the unit price.

3. Date and Time Extraction
Separated the date and time from a single column into distinct columns.
Extracted the day of the week and the name of the month from the date.

Step 2: Analysis Performed

1. Sales by Hour
Analyzed the relationship between sales (based on transaction quantities) and hours of the day.

Note: Initially assumed that transaction_id would reflect the number of orders, but found that a single transaction_id could include multiple items. Used transaction_qty to analyze sales.

2. Sales by Day of the Week
Calculated the total bill based on the day of the week.

3. Monthly Sales Analysis
Summarized the total bill for each month.

4. Sales by Product Category
Analyzed the total bill based on different product categories.

5. Top 5 Product Types by Revenue
Identified the top 5 products based on revenue.

6. Sales by Store Location
Evaluated the total bill generated by each store location.

7. Store Footfall
Measured footfall by counting the number of transaction_ids per store.

8. Sliced Data Analysis
Sliced the data by month and day of the week to observe trends and patterns.

Step 3: Measures Created

1. Total Sales
Calculated the total revenue generated.

2. Total Footfall
Counted the total number of transaction_ids to measure customer footfall.

3. Average Bill per Person
Calculated the average bill per person by dividing total sales by total footfall.

4. Average Order per Person
Determined the average order size per person by dividing total transaction quantity by the number of transaction_ids.

Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance at the coffee shop. The insights derived from this report can be utilized to optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and store operations.
